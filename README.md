 Text Summarization is basically creating a summary of long text by extracting core ideas. Extractive Text Summarization is to take up a document and extract important sentences from it as it is without changing any word.The algorithm based on ranking the sentences is based on TextRank and Word Frequency. Abstractive Text Summarization is creating a summary from a document depending on the semantics of the document and not the exact sentences, and we achieved it by using the Seq2Seq Model(LSTM). We chose two data set one is Amazon Review data set, which is a small size length text comprises of reviews shared by amazon customer about their products and second is CNN Daily Mails, which is medium size length mails and trained three models (TextRank, Word Frequency, Seq2Seq) on both the dataset to compare the results (summary generated) evaluated through rouge score
